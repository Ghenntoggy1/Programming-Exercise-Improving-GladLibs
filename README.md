PROJECT TITLE: "Programming Exercise: Improving GladLibs"

PURPOSE OF PROJECT: Use of ArrayLists to store efficiently data and work 
                    with them further. Another purpose was to use HashMaps
                    and to map multiple "key/value" pairs of data
                    Also, make use of Object oriented principle of programming. 
                    Assignment 1: Codon Count
                    task 1: count unique codonds in a DNA Strand from
                    a certain starting position; 
                    task 2: output every codon and its count that is between
                    num1 and num2; 
                    Assignment 2: Words in Files 
                    task 1: add all the words from a group of files into the map 
                    (example - in one of Shakespeareâ€™s plays) 
                    task 2: find the maximum number of files any word appears in, 
                    considering all words from a group of files 
                    task 3: find the names of the files this word 
                    appears in, one filename per line
                    Assignment 3: Maps Version of GladLibs
                    task 1: modify code so that it uses HashMaps instead
                    of multiple ArrayLists;
                    task 2: find the total number of words in all 
                    the ArrayLists in the HashMap.
                    task 3: find the total number of words in the ArrayLists 
                    of the categories that were used for a particular 
                    GladLib. If only noun, color, and adjective were 
                    the categories used in a GladLib, then only calculate 
                    the sum of all the words in those three ArrayLists.

USER INSTRUCTIONS: you will need 5 imports: 
                   edu.duke.FileResource; (simplified version of 
                   File function from Java)
                   edu.duke.DirectoryResource;
                   "java.util.ArrayList", 
                   "java.util.HashMap";
                   "java.util.File";
